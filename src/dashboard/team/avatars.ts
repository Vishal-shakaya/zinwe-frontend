/**
 * DashTeam: role colours (FR-19) and the drawn avatar library (FR-44).
 *
 * The library is `avatars.json` — 16 calm, flat head-and-shoulders people on a 48 × 48 box. It is THE source of
 * truth: the Windows app embeds a byte-identical copy and the backend knows the keys (z_devices/pictures.py
 * AVATAR_KEYS). Keys never change; art and labels may. Paths use only M L H V C Q A Z and never overlap
 * themselves, so SVG (nonzero) and WPF (EvenOdd) draw them the same. `bg` fills the whole box: clip it to a circle.
 * Initials on the role tint stay the fallback when a person has no picture.
