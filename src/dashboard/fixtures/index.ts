/**
 * THE sample-data seam (v1.3 UI build, 29 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Screens drawn in Prototype v2.2 that the API does not serve yet read typed sample data from this folder,
 * always through a loader with the same shape as a real API call — `(signal) => Promise<T>` — so a page uses it
 * with `useResource` exactly like `lib/api`. When the endpoint ships, the loader body becomes the API call and
 * nothing in the page changes.
 *
 * Every area that still reads sample data is listed in SAMPLE_AREAS (and in .claude/dev/docs/06-website-portal.md).
 *
 * SAMPLES_ON is THE switch. On in the dev server (`npm run dev`) and in a build made with VITE_SAMPLE_DATA=1;
 * off in every plain `npm run build` (production). When it is off, real owners never see sample data: the loaders
 * here return nothing (no tasks, no notes, no second PC…), the save functions do nothing, and the screens hide
 * every sample-only control (see SAMPLE_AREAS and 06-website-portal.md, "Dashboard v1.3 → Sample data in production").
